// Inspired by Bourbon - http://bourbon.io/
// requires Sass 3.2


// Addons & other mixins
// These are the CSS patterns and tricks you've learned
// since you were a kid. Clear fixes, hiding stuff from sight
// but not screenreaders, stuff like that.

@import "addons/clearfix";
@import "addons/font-size";
@import "addons/media-query";
@import "addons/prefixer";
@import "addons/hidden";
@import "addons/no-touch-hover";


// CSS Mixins
// Handy for those pesky vendor prefixes and experimental syntaxes and such,
// as well as helpers for writing sometimes verbose CSS more quickly.

@import "css/placeholder";
@import "css/user-select";


// Custom Functions
// Handy custom SASS functions such as unit and color conversions,
// list helpers, and such.

@import "functions/units";
@import "functions/colors";
